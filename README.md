# sink-repair
Given boilerplate code. Objective was to learn how to create a form and use an APT to pull external data into my code, using fetch and, also, how to create custom events after a POST operation is complete on the form. 
I created an ERD, linked above, based on data needed for this project. 

With this app, the customer can add info into the form, which will immediately add to the json database server. The request rendors to the screen and the company has the option to complete the order, which will then rendor to the screen, or delete the order.
