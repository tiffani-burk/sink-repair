# sink-repair
Given boilerplate code. Objective was to learn how to create a form and use an APT to pull external data into my code, using fetch and, also, how to create custom events after a POST operation is complete on the form. 
I created an ERD, linked above, based on data needed for this project. <img width="1919" alt="sink-repair screen shot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99150447/178160301-e13c7080-18d4-400e-82b5-3fc97771f1e0.png">
